🔧 Tech Behind the Scenes:
This web application is built using a modern full-stack stack:

TypeScript + JavaScript – for reliable and scalable development

React.js – for building the frontend interface

Node.js + Express – for backend APIs

MongoDB – to store music data, albums, and user information

Socket.IO – for real-time messaging

Clerk – for secure authentication and user management

Vite – fast and optimized build system

Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS – to build sleek, responsive, and accessible UIs

Cloudinary - For storing musics and albums

📌 Why I Built Sonique:

I built Sonique as a passion project to combine music and technology. My goal was to create an interactive, real-time platform where people can not only stream music but also communicate and share the moment with others.

This project reflects everything I've learned about full-stack development — from React on the frontend, to Node/Express on the backend, and real-time WebSocket communication using Socket.IO.
