📌 Why I Built Sonique:

I built Sonique as a passion project to combine music and technology. My goal was to create an interactive, real-time platform where people can not only stream music but also communicate and share the moment with others.

This project reflects everything I've learned about full-stack development — from React on the frontend, to Node/Express on the backend, and real-time WebSocket communication using Socket.IO.
